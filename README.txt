This is a basic fake news detector using a Convolutional Neural Network.
To use this, you need to download the WEL_FakeDataset in order to have data to train the model.

Please note the path in which you download the dataset, as you 
will need to specify the path of the csv file for the code to run.

When running the code, you can provide a single link or a 
pararaph of text from an article. 
Link shorteners such as tinyurl will work fine.

Make sure that before you provide the article, you specify which you are doing
by typing 1 for the copy-pasting of a paragraph
method, 2 for the pasting a link method, or 0 to exit the program. 
Frontend is still in development :(

Do not solely rely on this program to tell between real and fake news, 
as some results may be inaccurate. 

Because github doesn't allow uploading files over 25MB, you will need to download
the dataset separately. It can be found here:
